# ai-fleet-integration
A set of scripts used to install and run h2o ai on linux, mac and windows.
The goal of this repository was to integrate ChatDev with H2Oai, but i have ceased work on this repository since, in favour of developing LocalChatDev which works directly on the the original ChatDev repository with an addition of ollama to use as the ai-hosting service.
Scripts in this repo work, but won't be updated anymore, and since h2o-ai installation is very unstable and poorly documented, for some people these scripts may not be enough to get it properly running.
